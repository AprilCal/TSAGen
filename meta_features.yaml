# A list of 3 elements (e.g., [a, b, c], a is start value, b is end value, c is step length)
# means generatring this variable in variable-control manner.
# Only one controlled variable is allowed in a configuration file, and meanwhile, 
# other variables must be precise values (not meta feature).

# A list of 5 elements (e.g., [a, b, c, d, e], i.e., [min, lower_quartile, mid, upper_quartile, max])
# means meta feature. There can be multiple meta features in a configuration file.

# We give some examples below.

# Use meta features.
